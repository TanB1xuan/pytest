### What job dose this do?

**pytest** is a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy. 
Tests are expressive and readable—no boilerplate code required. Get started in minutes with a small unit test or complex functional test for your application or library.

### Files:

1. `test_PyTest_1.py` pytest: Assert that a certain exception is raised
1. `test_PyTest_2.py` develop multiple tests, test class
1. `test_PyTest_3.py` The -r flag can be used to display a 
“short test summary info” at the end of the test session, 
making it easy in large test suites to get a clear picture 
of all failures, skips, xfails, etc.
